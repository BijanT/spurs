Utilities for setting up and running experiments remotely.

This is kind of a "living repo". I will add to it utilities as I find them
useful (or people submit PRs).

It is heavily inspired by [spur.py](https://github.com/mwilliamson/spur.py) but
it also contains a bunch of utility routines that I have found useful.
