# spurs

Utilities for setting up and running experiments remotely.

This is kind of a "living repo". I will add to it utilities as I find them
useful (or people submit PRs).

It is heavily inspired by [spur.py](https://github.com/mwilliamson/spur.py) but
it also contains a bunch of utility routines that I have found useful.

To build, you need rust: https://rustup.rs. I used nightly rust `cargo
1.31.0-nightly (de314a8b2 2018-09-21)`, but I think all the features I used
will be stabilized in the next couple of months...
